# LudumDare49
My submition for the Ludum Dare Compo 49

Crush the Castle is a battle arena where you play as the king of the castle during a war. Protect your citizens, grab some cannon balls and take out the enemy castle.

Controls:
Move - WASD
Select - Left Mouse Button
Fire Cannon - Right Mouse Button
Zoom - C
Pause - Escape
Jump - Space

Notes: -The pause menu is a little weird where the cursor can get stuck in the overlay, just pressing escape should fix it.
-Only the Windows build has been tested.
-This game uses Unity’s High Definition Render Pipeline so there isn’t a WebGL build option.
